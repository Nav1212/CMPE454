Glossy reflection:

  feedback: "0/1 Calculate uniform random point on unit disk, not just in +x,+y quadrant  --  -1 a and b must be in the range [-1, 1] rather than [0, 1]"

  response: why would we lose marks for this? a and b both get squared, so the result is the same?


Antialiasing with jitter:
  
  feedback: "
    -1 Since (x,y) is the centre of the pixel (from the comment in the
       code), your xOffset and yOffset must be in the range
       [-0.5,+0.5].  For example, when numPixelSamples = 1, you are
       sampling at (x+0.5,y+0.5), which is the upper-right corner of
       the pixel.

    -1 jittering must be in [-0.5, 0.5] rather than [0, 1]"
  
  response: is this worth 2 marks off? The mistake is the same on both - incorrect coordinate used for the center of the pixel.
  

Soft shadows:
  
  feedback: "-1 Must pass -1 for the light index (last parameter), also, the condition to check if hit happens is always false."

  response: the condition if (found && triPointDist < intT + epsilon && triPointDist > intT - epsilon) does not always return false. 
            It works as intented.
